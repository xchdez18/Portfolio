  <p>My group was successful in syncing the song, Yankee Doodle, to our light show. Each light is grounded and only two jumper wires are connected to digital pins. Both cicrcuits have a ratio of 2 resistors:3 LEDs. One problem we ran into was when one set of LEDs were not working. The issue was not any part of the circuit, but the usb cable was not completely inserted. </p>
